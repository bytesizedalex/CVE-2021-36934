# CVE-2021-36934
CVE-2021-36934 PowerShell scripts

* Detection.ps1

This is a quick and dirty script to see if a machine may be vulnerable. It writes out a message to the shell indicating if BUILTIN\Users was detected in the permission list and includes the current permissions on the SAM path for validation.

If the system is unaffected or has been remediated you would see output similar to below - 

![Alt text](/PermissionsNotDetected.png?raw=true "PermissionsNotDetected")

* SCCM-Remediation.ps1

This is a basic PowerShell script for use in SCCM configuration items. It will remediate affected systems by resetting the permissions and removing any existing VSS shadow copies.
